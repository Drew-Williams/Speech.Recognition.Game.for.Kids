# Android Speech.Recognition.Game.for.Kids
A simple speech image recognition game for kids.  This utilizes Google's Speech Recognition API (when connected to wifi) to "decode" words spoken out loud to the users' Android device.

The user is shown one of ten random object/animal pictures after which the user says out loud what the object depicted in the image is called.  If the user guesses correctly, a .mp3 of clapping is played and a confirmation text message appears onscreen.  If the user guesses incoreectly, a .mp3 of a crowd "booing" is played along with an appropriate text message onscreen.  After a correct or an incorrect answer is registered by the app a new randomly selected image is drawn to the screen and the process starts over again.
